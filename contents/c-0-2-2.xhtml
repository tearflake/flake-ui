            he structure of content in FlakeUI is visualized in a distinctive way, resembling a form of a fractal
            arranged ovals where child ovals orbit around each parent oval recursively. Ovals themselves store
            textual or graphic information fitting into hierarchical parent-children relations. Dragging ovals
            around their parents enables walking horizontally through the tree (navigating through siblings), while
            dragging in or out of oval parent or children positions enables walking vertically through the
            hierarchical structure of data (focusing a parent or a child oval at central browsing area).
