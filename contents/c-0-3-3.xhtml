            inally, when we are done testing our site, we would want to publish it to a remote online server. To do
            this, we have to copy the entire file and folder structure from below the flakeUI-home-folder, to the
            remote online server home folder. We can usually do this by using control panel pages provided by the
            remote server, or using a custom
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_new">FTP client software</a>
            if we have an access to remote site FTP user name and password. If everything goes well, our new content
            should be happily spinning on the world wide web.
