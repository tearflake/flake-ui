            lakeUI brings a simple and minimalistic kind of content structuring and organization. All the pages are
            displayed inside a number of ovals that hierarchically relate between each other. Central oval is supposed
            to be used for reading and viewing content, while orbiting ovals are supposed to be used for content
            navigation. All the actions of browsing content are performed by dragging displayed elements by mouse
            (click-drag-release cycles), or by touch screen interaction (touch-drag-release cycles). Of course,
            hyperlinking is also supported by usual click or touch interaction.
