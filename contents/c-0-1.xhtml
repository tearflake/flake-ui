            lakeUI is intended to display static contents arranged within zoomable oval system.
            The latest version of FlakeUI loads content element pages on display demand, thus it is
            scallable as long as all the visible ovals together with their parent ovals fit into RAM.

            However, interaction with pages is reduced only to page panning and following hyperlinks.
            This limitation entails having no fancy event dependent animations or dynamic content tree
            structure. Still, FlakeUI could be used in a various scenarios where these limitations
            meet our expectations.
