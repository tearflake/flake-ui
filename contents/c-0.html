            hese pages are displayed with FlakeUI, and they contain FlakeUI use and content building instructions.
            The current version of FlakeUI represents an innovative graph based user interface hosting a digital
            content.
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a FlakeUI based content, one should possess a basic knowledge about editing XML, XHTML,
            and JSON files in text editor. XML files in FlakeUI define a hierarchical structure of XHTML content files.
            Some graph styling parameters can be adjusted by editing main JSON file placed in the FlakeUI root folder.
            The structured content is then spanned within asymptotic dynamically orbitable and zoomable fractal which can
            be navigated using mouse or touch gestures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the entire FlakeUI folder tree may be hosted as a standalone or embedded content at any HTTP address
            space.
