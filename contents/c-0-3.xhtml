        <p>
            o populate FlakeUI interface with custom content, it is necessary to prepare XHTML files
            representing our pages, to have an access to arbitrary textual editor, and it may be a good practice
            to have a local web server at disposition for testing our new site. FlakeUI represents a so-called flat
            file interface, meaning there is no basic information stored in remote databases, yet all the information
            needed for basic functioning is extracted only from file and folder structure accessed over HTTP interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            To corroborate flat file data system, it is possible to pair it with server side scripting technologies
            like ASP, PHP, Node.js, and others. FlakeUI should collaborate very well with such technologies, as long
            as the outcome conforms FlakeUI file and folder structures.
